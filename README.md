## What You Will Learn

Throughout this tutorial, you will learn the following key Git concepts and commands:

1. **Git Installation**  
   We'll start by ensuring Git is installed on your machine. You can check if Git is installed by running the command `git --version` in your terminal.

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**  
   You’ll learn how to create a new Git repository to start tracking your files. To initialize a new repository, use `git init "your-project-name"`.

3. **Checking the Status of Your Repository**  
   Learn how to check the current status of your repository to see changes and untracked files by using `git status`.

4. **Adding Files to the Staging Area**  
   Understand how to stage files so that Git starts tracking changes. To stage a file, run `git add <filename>`.

5. **Committing Changes**  
   We'll cover how to create a snapshot of your changes with a commit message. To commit your staged changes, use `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

6. **Creating and Switching Branches**  
   Learn to create a new branch for separate development work and how to switch between branches. You can create a new branch with `git branch <branch-name>` and switch to it using `git checkout <branch-name>`.

7. **Linking Your Local Repository to GitHub**  
   You'll learn how to connect your local Git repository to a GitHub remote repository, allowing collaboration and online storage. Use `git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` to link your local repo, and then push your changes with `git push -u origin master`.

8. **Pushing and Pulling Changes**  
   Finally, we’ll teach you how to push changes to GitHub and pull the latest changes from a remote repository. To push your changes, use `git push origin master`, and to pull the latest changes, run `git pull origin master`.
